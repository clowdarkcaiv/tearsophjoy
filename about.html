      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Sophia Antonio or Tearsophjoy (b.2000 in Cabanatuan, Philippines ) holds a Bachelor of Fine Arts Degree in Painting from the University of Santo Tomas. She works mainly with acrylic paintings, creating glowing scenes and landscapes that draw on her examination of vulnerability, sentimentality and alienation through personal perspectives, male gaze and objectifications.</p>
      <p>Having drifted through the motions of life, she navigated various environments, encountering both positive and negative experiences. It is through this journey that she has noticed a connection between her sentimentality and the liminal spaces she goes through in life.  </p>
	   <p>Inspired by theatrical imageries and film staging, she is interested in portraying the past, present, future, and the in-betweens in a single composition, aiming to capture the essence of the journey rather than the individual stops. The journey evokes memories carved into familiar buildings and etched onto the furniture and objects that clutter the spaces she has inhabited and those she will explore.</p>
